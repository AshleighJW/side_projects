This database contains rich information on the employee, customers and the details on the customers' purchases such as the expenses, tracks & albums purchased. 

## Aim
This is a SQL based analysis focusing on the track & album management. We looked into the following questions and made some data-based suggestions correspondingly:
- What are the sales revenue by country?
- How to decide which new albums to add to our stock in the US market?
- Should we update our sales strategy? Starting from deciding the customers preference between the current ones.
- How is our track selection in regards to genres? Do customers like the ones we picked for them?
