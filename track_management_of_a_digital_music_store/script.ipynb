    "Regarding to the *total sales*, **the US** is the largest market of Chinook, followed by **Canada** and **Brazil**. However, we notice that the *average customer value* of **Czech** is a lot higher than other countries, by at least \\$55.945. The customers from Czech also spent the most on each order on average. Other two countries with relatively high *average customer value* are **Portugal** and **India**, both are above $90. This view indicates a great potential of these markets.\n",

    "## Investigate the Purchasing Methods: Albums vs Individual Tracks¶\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chinook store is setup in a way that allows customer to make purchases in one of the two ways:\n",
    "- purchase a whole album\n",
    "- purchase a collection of one or more individual tracks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The store does not let customers purchase a whole album, and then add individual tracks to that same purchase (unless they do that by choosing each track manually). When customers purchase albums they are charged the same price as if they had purchased each of those tracks separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managers are currently considering changing our purchasing strategy to save money. The strategy they are considering is to purchase only the most popular tracks from each album from record companies, instead of purchasing every track from an album.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now will find out **what percentages of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums**. It helps the managers understand what effect this decision might have on the overall revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, there are two edge cases to consider:\n",
    "- Albums that have only one or two tracks are likely to be purchased by customers as part of a collection of individual tracks.\n",
    "- Customers may decide to manually select every track from an album, and then add a few individual tracks from other albums to their purchase.\n",
    "In the first case, since our analysis is concerned with maximizing revenue we can safely ignore albums consisting of only a few tracks. The company has previously done analysis to confirm that the second case does not happen often, so we can ignore this case also."

    "There are tracks of several genres are not sold at all, such as **World**, **Science Fiction**, **SCI Fi & Fanctasy**, **Rock and Roll**, **Opera**, **Comedy** and **Bosa Nova**. **Drama** and **TV Shows** only sold 1 or 2 tracks too. We should note that the genre **Opera** is differnt from others because only 1 track is on the shelf, it is therefore easy to have 100% unpurchased rate.  \n",

    "It it worth noting that we have 579 tracks in stock for **Latin** music, indicating a great range of Latin tracks we have here in Chinook. Nevertheless 79.4% of them have never been purchased. We should further look into this genre to find out the issue.\n"
