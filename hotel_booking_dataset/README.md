## Data Description
This dataset stores the booking information in the property management system (PMS) of **a resort hoetl** and **a city hotel**. They are located at the resort region of Algarve and the city of Lisbon in Portugal. 

The data from both hotels share the same structure, with **31 columns** describing **40,060 bookings of the resort hotel** and **79,330 booking of the city hotel**. The dataset comprehends bookings due to arrival between the **1st of July of 2015** and the **31st of August 2017**, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled.

Due to the large number of columns, the column description will be given in the scripy when mentioned for the first time.

## Aim
I looked into this dataset using a combination of Python and Tableau. The following questions are answered.

### Python analysis ([Hotel Booking Data Analysis - Part II: Data Analysis](https://github.com/AshleighJW/side_projects/blob/master/hotel_booking_dataset/script_data_analysis.ipynb))
- How does the cancelation rate look like? Is it especially higher for any market segmentation?
- What are the common profiles shared by the repeat customers?
- Does the current room type configuration meet the demand?

#### Tableau analysis
- How does the revenue vary by month?
- The contribution to revenue by market segment, customer type, the origin of customer country, and room type.
